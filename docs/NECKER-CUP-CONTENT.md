![Necker Island Aerial](https://www.virginlimitededition.com/media/fqxjncjn/necker-island-aerial-6.jpg)

The Necker Cup is a six-day, five-night all-inclusive pro-am tennis tournament held on Sir Richard Branson's private Necker Island in the British Virgin Islands. Founded in 2011 by **Remington Reynolds**, **Trevor Short**, and **Mike Richards (DJ Mehow)**, the event has grown into one of the most talked-about gatherings in the world of luxury tennis, bringing together Grand Slam champions, business leaders, musicians, and celebrities for a week of competition, connection, and charity.

The event is organized by **Premier Live** and **Mehow**, and is powered by the vision of creating something that goes beyond just a tennis tournament. It's part vacation, part networking summit, part music festival, and part charity fundraiser, all set against one of the most stunning backdrops on the planet.

## How It Works

![Necker Cup Tennis Court at Night](https://www.virgin.com/sites/virgin.com/files/necker-cup-2019-courts-night.jpg)

ATP and WTA tour players and legends are paired with amateur teams of all skill levels. A handicapped scoring format keeps things competitive for everyone, so you don't need to be a pro to have a shot at the finals. Teams of up to two amateurs partner with a pro, and over several days of round-robin play, the top teams advance to compete for the coveted Necker Cup trophy.

The tournament director is **Vasek Pospisil**, the Canadian tennis star who won the 2014 Wimbledon doubles title and helped Canada win the Davis Cup. Pospisil retired from professional tennis in 2025 after an 18-year ATP career, but his connection to the Necker Cup runs deep. He's been the tournament's heart and soul on the court for years.

Beyond the bracket play, the week builds toward a Pro Exhibition match on the final day, where the legends go head-to-head in front of all the guests before the big Charity Dinner & Auction.

Necker Island is a 74-acre private island owned by Sir Richard Branson, sitting in turquoise Caribbean waters surrounded by coral reefs and white sandy beaches. The island features the iconic Great House, multiple Balinese-style villas, championship tennis courts, and enough activities to fill a week without breaking a sweat (or breaking all of it, depending on how hard you go).

All tennis, meals, dinners, and parties take place on Necker Island. Guests staying on Moskito Island are just a 5-7 minute boat ride away.

### The Branson Beach Estate on Moskito Island

Moskito Island is Branson's neighboring private island, home to The Branson Beach Estate. The property offers stunning accommodation with private pools, ocean views, and the same level of luxury you'd expect from anything with the Branson name on it.

## Charity Impact

![Necker Cup Charity Auction](https://www.virgin.com/sites/virgin.com/files/necker-cup-charity-auction.jpg)

The Necker Cup has distributed over **$7 million** to charitable causes over its first decade-plus. In 2022 alone, over $900,000 was raised in a single edition. The primary beneficiaries include:

**Virgin Unite** - The entrepreneurial foundation of the Virgin Group. Richard Branson and the Virgin Group cover all overheads, meaning 100% of donations go directly to the frontline. Virgin Unite focuses on shining a spotlight on unacceptable issues, incubating disruptive collaborations, and empowering entrepreneurs to change business for good.

**National Tennis Foundation (NTF)** - A nationally recognized 501(c)(3) that provides scholarships and training opportunities to exceptional student athletes regardless of race or economic means. NTF is based in Las Vegas and has been supported at every single Necker Cup since the event's founding.

**BVI Lawn Tennis Association** - Dedicated to youth tennis development in the British Virgin Islands territory.

**Inspiring Children Foundation** - Co-founded by Ryan Wolfington, focused on providing comprehensive programs for underprivileged young people in academics, athletics, leadership and character development. Has provided over 70 scholarships to colleges including Harvard, Stanford, West Point, Princeton, and Georgetown.

In 2017, when Hurricane Irma destroyed much of Necker Island, the Cup temporarily relocated to Baha Mar Resort in Nassau, Bahamas, and directed the majority of that year's fundraising toward Virgin Unite's BVI Community Support Appeal for rebuilding efforts.

## The Necker Open (Golf)

Running alongside the tennis tournament in recent years, the Necker Open is a Pro-Am golf event held at Nail Bay's private course. Past golf participants have included Sir Nick Faldo, Greg Norman, Bryson DeChambeau, Tommy Fleetwood, Austin Cook, Sam Burns, and Matt Kuchar.
